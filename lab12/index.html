        <h1> Lab 12: Conditionals </h1>
        <h2> Challenge </h2>
        <p> We had to create a function that depended on a conditional to assign
          the user to a Hogwarts House depending on the length of their name.
         </p>
        <h2> Problems </h2>
          <p> Making the conditional was fairly straight forward, but it took me a
            while to out what variables I needed to include and where I needed to call them
            in the functions.
        <h2> Results </h2>
