		<h1> Lab 3 File Structures </h1>
		<h2> Purpose </h2>
			<p> The purpose of this lab was to set up and organize a well-made file structure.
				This will make things easier code as we continue.  </p>
		<h2> Challenges </h2
			<p> Overall, we didn't face too many challenges. It felt pretty straighforward
				for a lab. We think that this lab will help set us up for Lab 4.
		<h3> Results </h3>
			<p> Now we have nicely organized files so that the coding process can be smoother
				moving forward. Here are the screenshots of our results: </p>
